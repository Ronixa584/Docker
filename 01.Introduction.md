# Introduction to Docker - Lecture Notes

## Overview
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Docker?
- Docker is an open-source platform.
- Utilizes OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
- Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files.

### 2. Containers vs. Virtual Machines
- Containers are lightweight, share the host systemâ€™s kernel, and do not require an operating system per application.
- Virtual Machines (VMs) are heavy, require a full-blown OS for each instance, and are slower to start.

### 3. Docker Components
- **Dockerfile**: A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
- **Docker Images**: The blueprint of the application which forms the basis of containers.
- **Docker Containers**: Created from Docker images and run the actual application. A container represents a runtime for a single application, process, or service.
- **Docker Hub/Registry**: A library of pre-built images contributed by Docker users worldwide.

### 4. Benefits of Using Docker
- **Consistency**: Docker ensures consistency across multiple development, release cycles and standardizing your environment.
- **Isolation**: Dependencies or settings within a container do not affect other containers.
- **Security**: Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

## Practical Usage
- Docker can be used to run web applications in a self-contained environment.
- Simplifies configuration management.
- Streamlines deployment and scaling of applications.

## Getting Started with Docker
- Install Docker on your system.
- Begin by running simple containers and experimenting with basic Docker commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, and `docker images`.

## Conclusion
Docker is a powerful tool for developers that simplifies the process of developing, testing, and deploying applications. It helps in ensuring that applications work seamlessly in any environment.
